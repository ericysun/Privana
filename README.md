# Privana
### Privacy, Parsed.
A tool that helps users visualize and understand the data their apps track about them. Use our intuitive search feature to look up the apps you use and understand the permissions you give to your apps, giving you privacy and let you feel nirvana. 

### How Privana Works
We’ve indexed data from the top 100 apps on the App Store. For each app, we processed its privacy policy and enriched it with contextual information from across the web. This data is then analyzed using an LLM (Perplexity Sonar) to produce concise, readable summaries that clearly explain what information the app collects, how it’s used, and why. The data is then stored in a PostgreSQL database, which is searched through upon user queries.

But we go beyond just transparency. Privana also suggests:

- Privacy-conscious alternatives to popular apps that request excessive permissions or collect more data than necessary.
- Actionable privacy settings you can adjust within apps or on your device to reduce tracking and enhance your control.

By translating complex privacy practices into understandable insights and offering clear next steps, Privana helps you make smarter choices, not just about the apps you install, but how you navigate the web as a whole. Whether you're exploring new tools or tightening your settings, With support for hundreds more apps soon to come, Privana puts privacy knowledge at your fingertips.
